# ProactorAI

Anonymized version of ProactorAI program that pulls some device information from various APIs, sorts and stores appropriately. Then, it analyzes "health" of a site and creates a report with sites that are not 100% healthy. An example of the report appears in output.txt file.

This program was developed during my first co-op term.
